Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 65 Issued at 2200Z on 05 Mar 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 04/2100Z to
05/2100Z: Solar activity has been at low levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a C2 event observed at
05/1125Z from Region 3598 (S11W88). There are currently 10 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be low with
a chance for M-class flares on day one (06 Mar) and expected to be low
with a slight chance for an M-class flare on days two and three (07 Mar,
08 Mar).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 04/2100Z to 05/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to unsettled levels for the past 24 hours. Solar
wind speed reached a peak of 497 km/s at 04/2237Z. Total IMF reached 11
nT at 04/2100Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -6 nT at
04/2147Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached
a peak level of 196 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet levels on days one and two (06 Mar, 07 Mar) and quiet to
unsettled levels on day three (08 Mar).
