Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 35 Issued at 2200Z on 04 Feb 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 03/2100Z to
04/2100Z: Solar activity has been at moderate levels for the past 24
hours. The largest solar event of the period was a M1 event observed at
04/1638Z from Region 3576 (S16E72). There are currently 8 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is likely to be moderate
with a slight chance for an X-class flare on days one, two, and three
(05 Feb, 06 Feb, 07 Feb).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 03/2100Z to 04/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet levels for the past 24 hours. Solar wind speed
reached a peak of 449 km/s at 04/1933Z. Total IMF reached 9 nT at
04/1116Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -6 nT at
04/1654Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached
a peak level of 210 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to minor storm levels on day one (05 Feb), quiet to
unsettled levels on day two (06 Feb) and quiet levels on day three (07
Feb). Protons have a slight chance of crossing threshold on days one,
two, and three (05 Feb, 06 Feb, 07 Feb).
