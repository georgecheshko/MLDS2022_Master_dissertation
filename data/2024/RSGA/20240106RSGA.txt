Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 6 Issued at 2200Z on 06 Jan 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 05/2100Z to
06/2100Z: Solar activity has been at low levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a C7 event observed at
06/1535Z from Region 3538 (N21W28). There are currently 8 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be low with
a chance for M-class flares and a slight chance for an X-class flare on
days one, two, and three (07 Jan, 08 Jan, 09 Jan).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 05/2100Z to 06/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet levels for the past 24 hours. Solar wind speed
reached a peak of 399 km/s at 05/2129Z.  Protons greater than 10 MeV at
geosynchronous orbit reached a peak level of 6 pfu at 06/0030Z.
Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached a peak
level of 155 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to unsettled levels on days one, two, and three (07 Jan,
08 Jan, 09 Jan). Protons have a slight chance of crossing threshold on
days one, two, and three (07 Jan, 08 Jan, 09 Jan).
