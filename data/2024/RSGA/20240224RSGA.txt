Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 55 Issued at 2200Z on 24 Feb 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 23/2100Z to
24/2100Z: Solar activity has been at moderate levels for the past 24
hours. The largest solar event of the period was a M4 event observed at
24/0634Z from Region 3590 (N18W01). There are currently 5 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is likely to be moderate
with a chance for X-class flares on days one, two, and three (25 Feb, 26
Feb, 27 Feb).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 23/2100Z to 24/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to unsettled levels for the past 24 hours. Solar
wind speed reached a peak of 408 km/s at 24/1621Z. Total IMF reached 11
nT at 24/1952Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -8 nT at
24/1932Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached
a peak level of 104 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to minor storm levels on day one (25 Feb), quiet to
unsettled levels on day two (26 Feb) and quiet levels on day three (27
Feb). Protons have a slight chance of crossing threshold on days one,
two, and three (25 Feb, 26 Feb, 27 Feb).
