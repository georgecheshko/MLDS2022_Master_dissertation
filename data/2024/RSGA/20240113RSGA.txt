Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 13 Issued at 2200Z on 13 Jan 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 12/2100Z to
13/2100Z: Solar activity was at low levels. The largest flare of the
period was a C2.7 at 13/0421 UTC from a region just beyond the ENE limb.
Region 3541 (S22W33, Dao/beta-delta) exhibited some consolidation and
formed a weak delta configuration. The other 12 spotted regions only had
minor changes throughout the period. No Earth-directed CMEs were
observed in available coronagraph imagery.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be low with
a chance for M-class flares on days one, two, and three (14 Jan, 15 Jan,
16 Jan).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 12/2100Z to 13/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet levels for the past 24 hours. Solar wind speed
reached a peak of 502 km/s at 13/0056Z. Total IMF reached 5 nT at
13/1949Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -4 nT at
13/1830Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached
a peak level of 156 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to unsettled levels on days one and three (14 Jan, 16
Jan) and quiet levels on day two (15 Jan).
