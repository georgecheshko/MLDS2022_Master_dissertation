Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 59 Issued at 2200Z on 28 Feb 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 27/2100Z to
28/2100Z: Solar activity has been at low levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a C5 event observed at
28/0909Z. There are currently 7 numbered sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be low with
a chance for M-class flares and a slight chance for an X-class flare on
days one, two, and three (29 Feb, 01 Mar, 02 Mar).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 27/2100Z to 28/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet levels for the past 24 hours. Solar wind speed
reached an estimated peak of 470 km/s. Total IMF reached 5 nT at
28/0956Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -5 nT at
28/0956Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached
a peak level of 128 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to unsettled levels on days one, two, and three (29 Feb,
01 Mar, 02 Mar). Protons have a slight chance of crossing threshold on
days one, two, and three (29 Feb, 01 Mar, 02 Mar).
