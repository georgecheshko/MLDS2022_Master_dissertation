Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 48 Issued at 2200Z on 17 Feb 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 16/2100Z to
17/2100Z: Solar activity has been at moderate levels for the past 24
hours. The largest solar event of the period was a M3 event observed at
16/2209Z from Region 3576 (S16W98). There are currently 7 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be low with
a chance for M-class flares on days one, two, and three (18 Feb, 19 Feb,
20 Feb).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 16/2100Z to 17/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet levels for the past 24 hours. Solar wind speed
reached a peak of 404 km/s at 16/2318Z. Total IMF reached 8 nT at
17/2058Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -6 nT at
17/0224Z.  Protons greater than 10 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached a
peak level of 2 pfu at 17/0515Z.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet levels on day one (18 Feb) and quiet to unsettled levels
on days two and three (19 Feb, 20 Feb).
