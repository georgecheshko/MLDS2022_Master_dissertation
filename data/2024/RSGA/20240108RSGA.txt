Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 8 Issued at 2200Z on 08 Jan 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 07/2100Z to
08/2100Z: Solar activity has been at low levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a C8 event observed at
07/2225Z. There are currently 9 numbered sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be low with
a chance for M-class flares and a slight chance for an X-class flare on
days one, two, and three (09 Jan, 10 Jan, 11 Jan).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 07/2100Z to 08/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet levels for the past 24 hours. Solar wind speed
reached a peak of 361 km/s at 08/1806Z. Total IMF reached 8 nT at
08/1744Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -5 nT at
08/1847Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached
a peak level of 147 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to unsettled levels on day one (09 Jan) and quiet levels
on days two and three (10 Jan, 11 Jan). Protons have a slight chance of
crossing threshold on days one, two, and three (09 Jan, 10 Jan, 11 Jan).
