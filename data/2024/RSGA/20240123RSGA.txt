Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 23 Issued at 2200Z on 23 Jan 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 22/2100Z to
23/2100Z: Solar activity has been at high levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a M5 event observed at
23/0331Z from Region 3559 (N27W03). There are currently 7 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be moderate
with a slight chance for an X-class flare on days one, two, and three
(24 Jan, 25 Jan, 26 Jan).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 22/2100Z to 23/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to active levels for the past 24 hours. Solar
wind speed reached a peak of 444 km/s at 22/2137Z. Total IMF reached 12
nT at 22/2105Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -4 nT at
23/0941Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached
a peak level of 147 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to minor storm levels on days one and three (24 Jan, 26
Jan) and unsettled to minor storm levels on day two (25 Jan). Protons
have a slight chance of crossing threshold on days one, two, and three
(24 Jan, 25 Jan, 26 Jan).
