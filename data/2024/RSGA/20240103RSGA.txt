Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 3 Issued at 2200Z on 03 Jan 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 02/2100Z to
03/2100Z: Solar activity has been at low levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a C3 event observed at
03/1018Z from Region 3536 (N06E37). There are currently 4 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is likely to be moderate
with a chance for X-class flares on days one, two, and three (04 Jan, 05
Jan, 06 Jan).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 02/2100Z to 03/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to unsettled levels for the past 24 hours. Solar
wind speed reached a peak of 496 km/s at 03/1952Z. Total IMF reached 11
nT at 03/0517Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -8 nT at
03/1825Z.  Protons greater than 10 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached a
peak level of 11 pfu at 03/2025Z. Electrons greater than 2 MeV at
geosynchronous orbit reached a peak level of 261 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to unsettled levels on day one (04 Jan) and quiet levels
on days two and three (05 Jan, 06 Jan). Protons have a chance of
crossing threshold on days one, two, and three (04 Jan, 05 Jan, 06 Jan).
