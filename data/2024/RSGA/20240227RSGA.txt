Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 58 Issued at 2200Z on 27 Feb 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 26/2100Z to
27/2100Z: Solar activity has been at low levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a C3 event observed at
27/0742Z from Region 3590 (N18W40). There are currently 6 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be low with
a chance for M-class flares and a slight chance for an X-class flare on
days one, two, and three (28 Feb, 29 Feb, 01 Mar).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 26/2100Z to 27/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to minor storm levels for the past 24 hours.
Solar wind speed reached a peak of 534 km/s at 27/0703Z. Total IMF
reached 8 nT at 26/2357Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached
-7 nT at 27/0148Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit
reached a peak level of 148 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to unsettled levels on day one (28 Feb) and quiet levels
on days two and three (29 Feb, 01 Mar). Protons have a slight chance of
crossing threshold on days one, two, and three (28 Feb, 29 Feb, 01 Mar).
