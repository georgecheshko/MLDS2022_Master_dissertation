Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 36 Issued at 2200Z on 05 Feb 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 04/2100Z to
05/2100Z: Solar activity has been at moderate levels for the past 24
hours. The largest solar event of the period was a M2 event observed at
04/2237Z from Region 3576 (S16E72). There are currently 11 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is likely to be moderate
with a chance for X-class flares on days one and two (06 Feb, 07 Feb)
and expected to be low with a chance for M-class flares and a slight
chance for an X-class flare on day three (08 Feb).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 04/2100Z to 05/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to unsettled levels for the past 24 hours. Solar
wind speed reached a peak of 468 km/s at 05/1757Z. Total IMF reached 11
nT at 05/1611Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -9 nT at
05/1624Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached
a peak level of 138 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to unsettled levels on day one (06 Feb) and quiet levels
on days two and three (07 Feb, 08 Feb). Protons have a slight chance of
crossing threshold on days one and two (06 Feb, 07 Feb) and have a
slight chance of crossing threshold on day three (08 Feb).
