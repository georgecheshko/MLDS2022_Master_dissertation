Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 45 Issued at 2200Z on 14 Feb 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 13/2100Z to
14/2100Z: Solar activity has been at moderate levels for the past 24
hours. The largest solar event of the period was a M1 event observed at
14/0310Z from Region 3582 (N06W40). There are currently 7 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is likely to be moderate
with a slight chance for an X-class flare on days one and two (15 Feb,
16 Feb) and expected to be low with a chance for M-class flares on day
three (17 Feb).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 13/2100Z to 14/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to unsettled levels for the past 24 hours. Solar
wind speed reached a peak of 510 km/s at 14/0853Z. Total IMF reached 7
nT at 14/0607Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -5 nT at
14/0145Z.  Protons greater than 10 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached a
peak level of 47 pfu at 14/1030Z. Electrons greater than 2 MeV at
geosynchronous orbit reached a peak level of 110 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to unsettled levels on day one (15 Feb) and quiet levels
on days two and three (16 Feb, 17 Feb). Protons greater than 10 Mev are
expected to cross threshold on day one (15 Feb) and have a slight chance
of crossing threshold on day two (16 Feb).
