Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 54 Issued at 2200Z on 23 Feb 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 22/2100Z to
23/2100Z: Solar activity has been at high levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a X6 event observed at
22/2234Z from Region 3590 (N18E26). There are currently 6 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is likely to be moderate
with a chance for X-class flares on days one, two, and three (24 Feb, 25
Feb, 26 Feb).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 22/2100Z to 23/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet levels for the past 24 hours. Solar wind speed
reached a peak of 368 km/s at 22/2315Z. Total IMF reached 6 nT at
23/1639Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -4 nT at
23/0944Z.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet levels on day one (24 Feb), quiet to minor storm levels
on day two (25 Feb) and quiet to unsettled levels on day three (26 Feb).
Protons have a slight chance of crossing threshold on days one, two, and
three (24 Feb, 25 Feb, 26 Feb).
