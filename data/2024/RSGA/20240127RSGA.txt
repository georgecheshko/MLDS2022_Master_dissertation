SDF Number 27 Issued at 2200Z on 27 Jan 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 26/2100Z to
27/2100Z: Solar activity has been at low levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a C2 event observed at

a chance for M-class flares on days one, two, and three (28 Jan, 29 Jan,
30 Jan).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 26/2100Z to 27/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to unsettled levels for the past 24 hours. Solar
wind speed reached a peak of 489 km/s at 26/2108Z. Total IMF reached 6
nT at 27/1024Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -4 nT at
