Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 38 Issued at 2200Z on 07 Feb 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 06/2100Z to
07/2100Z: Solar activity has been at high levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a M5 event observed at
07/0331Z from Region 3575 (S37W90). There are currently 10 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is likely to be moderate
with a chance for X-class flares on day one (08 Feb) and expected to be
low with a chance for M-class flares and a slight chance for an X-class
flare on days two and three (09 Feb, 10 Feb).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 06/2100Z to 07/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet levels for the past 24 hours. Solar wind speed
reached a peak of 546 km/s at 07/0202Z. Total IMF reached 6 nT at
06/2110Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -4 nT at
07/0241Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached
a peak level of 116 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet levels on day one (08 Feb) and quiet to active levels on
days two and three (09 Feb, 10 Feb). Protons have a chance of crossing
threshold on day one (08 Feb) and have a slight chance of crossing
threshold on days two and three (09 Feb, 10 Feb).
