Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 31 Issued at 2200Z on 31 Jan 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 30/2100Z to
31/2100Z: Solar activity has been at low levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a C4 event observed at
31/0829Z from Region 3567 (N19E54). There are currently 5 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be low with
a chance for M-class flares on days one, two, and three (01 Feb, 02 Feb,
03 Feb).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 30/2100Z to 31/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet levels for the past 24 hours. Solar wind speed
reached a peak of 504 km/s at 30/2131Z.  Protons greater than 10 MeV at
geosynchronous orbit reached a peak level of 2 pfu at 31/0035Z.
Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached a peak
level of 196 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet levels on days one, two, and three (01 Feb, 02 Feb, 03
Feb). Protons greater than 10 Mev have a slight chance of crossing
threshold on day one (01 Feb).
