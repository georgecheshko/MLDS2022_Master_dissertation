Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 5 Issued at 2200Z on 05 Jan 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 04/2100Z to
05/2100Z: Solar activity has been at low levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a C3 event observed at
05/0809Z from Region 3534 (S15W61). There are currently 7 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be low with
a chance for M-class flares and a slight chance for an X-class flare on
days one, two, and three (06 Jan, 07 Jan, 08 Jan).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 04/2100Z to 05/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to unsettled levels for the past 24 hours. Solar
wind speed reached a peak of 504 km/s at 05/1209Z.  Protons greater than
10 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached a peak level of 25 pfu at
05/0035Z. Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached a
peak level of 140 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet levels on day one (06 Jan) and quiet to unsettled levels
on days two and three (07 Jan, 08 Jan). Protons have a slight chance of
crossing threshold on days one, two, and three (06 Jan, 07 Jan, 08 Jan).
