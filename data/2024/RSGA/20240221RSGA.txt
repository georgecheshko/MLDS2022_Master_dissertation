Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 52 Issued at 2200Z on 21 Feb 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 20/2100Z to
21/2100Z: Solar activity has been at low levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a C4 event observed at
21/0217Z. There are currently 2 numbered sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be low with
a chance for M-class flares on days one and two (22 Feb, 23 Feb) and
expected to be low with a chance for M-class flares and a slight chance
for an X-class flare on day three (24 Feb).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 20/2100Z to 21/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to unsettled levels for the past 24 hours. Solar
wind speed reached a peak of 376 km/s at 21/1527Z. Total IMF reached 9
nT at 20/2303Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -5 nT at
21/1525Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached
a peak level of 107 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet levels on days one, two, and three (22 Feb, 23 Feb, 24
Feb).
