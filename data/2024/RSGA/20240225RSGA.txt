Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 56 Issued at 2200Z on 25 Feb 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 24/2100Z to
25/2100Z: Solar activity has been at moderate levels for the past 24
hours. The largest solar event of the period was a M2 event observed at
25/1722Z from Region 3590 (N18W13). There are currently 6 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is likely to be moderate
with a chance for X-class flares on days one, two, and three (26 Feb, 27
Feb, 28 Feb).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 24/2100Z to 25/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to unsettled levels for the past 24 hours. Solar
wind speed reached a peak of 459 km/s at 25/0358Z. Total IMF reached 13
nT at 25/1925Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -9 nT at
25/0734Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached
a peak level of 111 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to unsettled levels on days one, two, and three (26 Feb,
27 Feb, 28 Feb). Protons have a slight chance of crossing threshold on
days one, two, and three (26 Feb, 27 Feb, 28 Feb).
