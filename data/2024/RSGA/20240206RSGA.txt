Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 37 Issued at 2200Z on 06 Feb 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 05/2100Z to
06/2100Z: Solar activity has been at moderate levels for the past 24
hours. The largest solar event of the period was a M4 event observed at
06/0312Z from Region 3575 (S36W78). There are currently 10 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is likely to be moderate
with a chance for X-class flares on day one (07 Feb) and expected to be
low with a chance for M-class flares and a slight chance for an X-class
flare on days two and three (08 Feb, 09 Feb).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 05/2100Z to 06/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to unsettled levels for the past 24 hours. Solar
wind speed reached a peak of 1104 km/s at 06/0820Z. Total IMF reached 10
nT at 05/2306Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -5 nT at
06/0135Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached
a peak level of 163 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to unsettled levels on day one (07 Feb), quiet levels on
day two (08 Feb) and quiet to active levels on day three (09 Feb).
Protons have a chance of crossing threshold on day one (07 Feb) and have
a slight chance of crossing threshold on days two and three (08 Feb, 09
Feb).
