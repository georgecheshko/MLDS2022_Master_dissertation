Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 43 Issued at 2200Z on 12 Feb 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 11/2100Z to
12/2100Z: Solar activity has been at high levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a M6 event observed at
12/0348Z from Region 3576 (S17W37). There are currently 7 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be moderate
with a chance for X-class flares on days one, two, and three (13 Feb, 14
Feb, 15 Feb).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 11/2100Z to 12/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet levels for the past 24 hours. Solar wind speed
reached a peak of 705 km/s at 12/0646Z. Total IMF reached 7 nT at
11/2340Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -5 nT at
11/2257Z.  Protons greater than 10 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached a
peak level of 81 pfu at 12/1550Z. Electrons greater than 2 MeV at
geosynchronous orbit reached a peak level of 159 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at unsettled to major storm levels on day one (13 Feb), unsettled
to minor storm levels on day two (14 Feb) and quiet levels on day three
(15 Feb). Protons are expected to cross threshold on day one (13 Feb),
have a chance of crossing threshold on day two (14 Feb) and have a
chance of crossing threshold on day three (15 Feb).
