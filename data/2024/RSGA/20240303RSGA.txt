Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 63 Issued at 2200Z on 03 Mar 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 02/2100Z to
03/2100Z: Solar activity has been at low levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a C3 event observed at
03/1729Z. There are currently 7 numbered sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be low with
a chance for M-class flares on days one and two (04 Mar, 05 Mar) and
expected to be low with a slight chance for an M-class flare on day
three (06 Mar).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 02/2100Z to 03/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to minor storm levels for the past 24 hours.
Solar wind speed reached a peak of 481 km/s at 03/0528Z. Total IMF
reached 19 nT at 03/1108Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached
-17 nT at 03/1513Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous
orbit reached a peak level of 383 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to active levels on day one (04 Mar) and quiet levels on
days two and three (05 Mar, 06 Mar).
