Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 4 Issued at 2200Z on 04 Jan 2024

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 03/2100Z to
04/2100Z: Solar activity has been at moderate levels for the past 24
hours. The largest solar event of the period was a M3 event observed at
04/0155Z from Region 3536 (N06E24). There are currently 4 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be low with
a chance for M-class flares and a slight chance for an X-class flare on
days one, two, and three (05 Jan, 06 Jan, 07 Jan).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 03/2100Z to 04/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to unsettled levels for the past 24 hours. Solar
wind speed reached a peak of 481 km/s at 03/2122Z. Total IMF reached 8
nT at 03/2138Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -3 nT at
04/1705Z.  Protons greater than 10 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached a
peak level of 20 pfu at 04/0835Z. Electrons greater than 2 MeV at
geosynchronous orbit reached a peak level of 120 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet levels on days one and two (05 Jan, 06 Jan) and quiet to
unsettled levels on day three (07 Jan). Protons are expected to cross
threshold on day one (05 Jan) and have a slight chance of crossing
threshold on days two and three (06 Jan, 07 Jan).
